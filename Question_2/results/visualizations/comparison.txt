The visualizations in the analysis make it easier to understand the relationships and distributions within the data. The scatter plot between math and reading scores provides an immediate visual representation of the relationship between these two variables, making it easy to spot trends or outliers. The box plot comparing math scores by gender visually shows the distribution, central tendency, and any potential gender differences or outliers in the math performance. The histogram of math scores helps assess the overall distribution of scores, revealing whether they are skewed or follow a normal distribution and highlighting areas of high frequency or unusual patterns. The count plot for test preparation course completion offers a clear view of how many students completed the course, helping to identify any imbalance or trends in participation. Lastly, the pair plot visualizes the relationships between math, reading, and writing scores, making detecting correlations and patterns across these variables easier. Together, these visualizations simplify the analysis by providing quick, intuitive insights into the data, allowing for a deeper understanding of how different variables are related and how they behave individually.
